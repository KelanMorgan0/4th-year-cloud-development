##  Question 1  ##
##  Check if your processor supports Intel/AMD virtualization technology. Enable Intel virtualization technology in BIOS if possible.  ##

	Completed

##  Question 2  ##
##  The cloud is almost everywhere in our lives now. What do you think are the fundamental reasons behind its success? Name three pros and three cons of cloud.  ##

	the simplicity and accessability of cloud solutions which allow new companys to not go through the task of setting up a local server and maintain it on a regular basis, while not worrying about running out of storage
	pros:
	• scalability, the users dont need to worry about how much storage their server has, or how many users are on it at any given time
	• cost, you only need to pay for what you use
	• accessability, very easy to access the server or database from anywhere
	cons:
	• requires internet connection
	• the data is in a server owned by someone else
	• outages or downtime that is out of your control

##  Question 3  ##
##  What is the primary function of a hypervisor in virtualization?  ##

	a hypervisor manages virtual machines and allows multiple virtual machines to run on one device

##  Question 4  ##
##  What is a virtual machine (VM)?  ##

	a VM is an emulator that runs an opperating system like a normal machine, but only uses a fraction of the hardware

##  Question 5  ##
##  What are the benefits of using virtual machines?  ##

	• easy to backup and recover to one of the backups
	• testing and development is very easy
	• reasource efficiency - more efficient than running it your self

##  Question 6  ##
##  List five use cases of virtual machines.  ##

	• testing in different opperating systems
	• running old code that requires old opperating systems
	• learning a new environment
	• isolated development with no risk of breaking a computer
	• server consolidation

##  Question 7  ##
##  In virtualization, what is the guest operating system?  ##

	Answer: b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine

##  Question 8  ##
##  What does virtual machine isolation mean?  ##

	Answer: c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system

##  Question 9  ##
##  What is the benefit of virtual machine portability?  ##

	Answer: c) It allows virtual machines to be moved between different physical machines with compatible hypervisors

##  Question 10 ##
##  What is the purpose of cloning a virtual machine?  ##

	cloaning a virtual machine is great for quick deployment, testing your project without messing with your original vm and backing up and recovering in case of a problem
